What the project does: Quantitative image-based cytometry (QIBC) code written in R for analyzing individual foci in mammalian cells by creating a cell cycle profile of the dynamic changes in the number of foci. This code helps to create a specific cell-cycle profile based on DAPI (marker of DNA content) and EdU (marker of replicating cells) intensity in cells. Cell cycle phases are divided into the following: G1. Early S, Mid S, Late S and G2.
